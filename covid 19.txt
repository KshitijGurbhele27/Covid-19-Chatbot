Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).[10] It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and has resulted in an ongoing pandemic. As of 16 September 2020, more than 29.6 million cases have been reported across 188 countries and territories with more than 936,000 deaths; more than 20.1 million people have recovered.[9]

Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath or breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste.[7] While most people have mild symptoms, some people develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) possibly precipitated by cytokine storm,[11] multi-organ failure, septic shock, and blood clots. The incubation period may range from two to fourteen days.
The virus is spread primarily via small droplets from coughing, sneezing, and talking. The droplets are usually not airborne; however, those standing in close proximity may inhale them and become infected.[a] People may also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their face. The transmission may also occur through aerosols that can stay suspended in the air for longer periods of time in enclosed spaces. It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread is possible before symptoms appear, and from people who are asymptomatic.[7][12] The standard method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab. Chest CT imaging may also be helpful for diagnosis in individuals where there is a high suspicion of infection based on symptoms and risk factors, however guidelines do not recommend using it for routine screening.

Recommended measures to prevent infection include frequent hand washing, social distancing, quarantine, covering coughs, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face.[8] The use of cloth face coverings such as a scarf or a bandana has been recommended by health officials in public settings to minimise the risk of transmissions, with some authorities requiring their use. Health officials also stated that medical-grade face masks, such as N95 masks, should be used only by healthcare workers, first responders, and those who directly care for infected individuals.

There are no proven vaccines or specific treatments for COVID-19. Management involves the treatment of symptoms, supportive care, isolation, and experimental measures. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID‑19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC)[13][14] on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March 2020.[15] Local transmission of the disease has occurred in most countries across all six WHO regions.[16]

Longer-term damage to organs (in particular lungs and heart) has been observed, and there is concern about a significant number of patients who have recovered from the acute phase of the disease but continue to experience a range of effects including severe fatigue, memory loss and other cognitive issues, low grade fever, muscle weakness, breathlessness and other symptoms for months afterwards.
Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but usually include fever and a cough.[22][6] People with the same infection may have different symptoms, and their symptoms may change over time. For example, one person may have a high fever, a cough, and fatigue, and another person may have a low fever at the start of the disease and develop difficulty breathing a week later. All of the symptoms of COVID-19 are non-specific, which means that they are also seen in some other diseases.

Fever is the most common symptom of COVID‑19.[22] The fever may be high or low. Most people with COVID-19 develop a fever at some point.[22] Most people with COVID-19 also have a cough, which could be either dry or a productive cough.[22]

Other typical symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath and muscle and joint pains.[22][6] Some symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, are more common in patients who need hospital care.[6] Shortness of breath tends to develop later in the illness.

About 40% of people temporarily lose their sense of smell (called anosmia), experience changes in how food tastes (dysgeusia), or have other disturbances to their normal abilities to smell or taste.[6][23] This symptom, if it is present at all, often appears early in the illness.[23] A disturbance in smell or taste is more commonly found in younger people, and perhaps because of this, it is associated with a lower risk of medical complications.[23] Although most people with COVID-19 do not experience these symptoms, it is an unusual symptom for other respiratory diseases, so it is used for symptom-based screening.[23]

Other symptoms are less common among people with COVID-19. Some people experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as loss of appetite, diarrhoea, or nausea.[6][24] Some people have a sore throat, headache, vertigo, or other symptoms.[22][6]

As is common with infections, there is a delay, known as the incubation period, between the moment a person first becomes infected and the appearance of the first symptoms. The median incubation period for COVID‑19 is four to five days.[25] Most symptomatic people experience symptoms within two to seven days after exposure, and almost all symptomatic people will experience one or more symptoms before day twelve.[25][26] Some symptoms usually appear sooner than others. In August 2020, scientists at the University of Southern California reported the "likely" order of initial symptoms of the COVID-19 disease as a fever followed by a cough and muscle pain, and that nausea and vomiting usually appear before diarrhoea.[27] This contrasts with the most common path for influenza where it is common to develop a cough first and fever later.[27]

Some people are infected with the virus but do not develop noticeable symptoms at any point in time.[28] These asymptomatic carriers tend not to get tested, and they can spread the disease.[29][30][28] Other infected people will develop symptoms later (called pre-symptomatic) or have very mild symptoms (called paucisymptomatic), and can also spread the virus.COVID‑19 is a new disease, and many of the details of its spread are under investigation.[7][12][31] It spreads easily between people—more easily than influenza but not as easily as measles.[12] People are most infectious when they show symptoms (even mild or non-specific symptoms), but may be infectious for up to two days before symptoms appear (pre-symptomatic transmission).[31] They remain infectious for an estimated seven to twelve days in moderate cases and an average of two weeks in severe cases.[31] People can also transmit the virus without showing any symptom (asymptomatic transmission), but it is unclear how often this happens.[7][12][31] A June 2020 review found that 40–45% of infected people are asymptomatic.[32]

COVID‑19 spreads primarily when people are in close contact and one person inhales small droplets produced by an infected person (symptomatic or not) coughing, sneezing, talking, or singing.[31][33] The WHO recommends 1 metre (3 ft) of social distance;[7] the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends 2 metres (6 ft).[12]

Transmission may also occur through aerosols, smaller droplets that are able to stay suspended in the air for longer periods of time.[34] Experimental results show the virus can survive in aerosol for up to three hours.[35] Some outbreaks have also been reported in crowded and inadequately ventilated indoor locations where infected persons spend long periods of time (such as restaurants and nightclubs).[36] Aerosol transmission in such locations has not been ruled out.[34] Some medical procedures performed on COVID‑19 patients in health facilities can generate those smaller droplets,[37] and result in the virus being transmitted more easily than normal.[7][31]

Less commonly, when the contaminated droplets fall to floors or surfaces they can remain infectious if people touch contaminated surfaces and then their eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.[7] On surfaces the amount of viable active virus decreases over time until it can no longer cause infection,[31] and surfaces are thought not to be the main way the virus spreads.[12] The level of contamination required to transmit infection via surfaces is unknown, but the virus can be detected for up to four hours on copper, up to one day on cardboard, and up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304).[31][38][39] Surfaces are easily decontaminated with household disinfectants which destroy the virus outside the human body or on the hands.[7] Disinfectants or bleach are not a medical treatment for COVID‑19, and cause health problems when not used properly, such as when used inside the human body.[40]

Sputum and saliva carry large amounts of virus.[7][12][31][41] Although COVID‑19 is not a sexually transmitted infection, direct contact such as kissing, intimate contact, and fecal–oral routes are suspected to transmit the virus.[42][43] The virus may occur in breast milk, but whether it is transmittable to the baby is unknown.[44][45]

Estimates of the number of people infected by one person with COVID‑19, the R0, have varied. The WHO's initial estimates of R0 were 1.4–2.5 (average 1.95); however, a review in early April 2020 found the basic R0 (without control measures) to be higher at 3.28 and the median R0 to be 2.79.[46] However, a CDC study from the same month found that the median R0 of the virus was 5.7, with a basic R0 potentially as high as 8.9 without control measures, with a 95% confidence intervalSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. It was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.[48] All features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in related coronaviruses in nature.[49]

Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubble.[50]

SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.[51] It is thought to have an animal (zoonotic) origin. Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the genus Betacoronavirus, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) together with two bat-derived strains. It is 96% identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).COVID‑19 can affect the upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) and the lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs).[53] The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID‑19 because the virus accesses host cells via the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant in type II alveolar cells of the lungs.[54] The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a "spike" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.[55] The density of ACE2 in each tissue correlates with the severity of the disease in that tissue and some have suggested decreasing ACE2 activity might be protective,[56][57][unreliable medical source?] though another view is that increasing ACE2 using angiotensin II receptor blocker medications could be protective.[58] As the alveolar disease progresses, respiratory failure might develop and death may follow.[57][unreliable medical source?]

SARS-CoV-2 may also cause respiratory failure through affecting the brainstem as other coronaviruses have been found to invade the central nervous system (CNS). While virus has been detected in cerebrospinal fluid of autopsies, the exact mechanism by which it invades the CNS remains unclear and may first involve invasion of peripheral nerves given the low levels of ACE2 in the brain.[59][60][unreliable medical source?]

The virus also affects gastrointestinal organs as ACE2 is abundantly expressed in the glandular cells of gastric, duodenal and rectal epithelium[61] as well as endothelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine.[62][unreliable medical source?]

The virus can cause acute myocardial injury and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system.[63] An acute cardiac injury was found in 12% of infected people admitted to the hospital in Wuhan, China,[64] and is more frequent in severe disease.[65][unreliable medical source?] Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, owing to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial injuries may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.[63] ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in heart function.[63][66] A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) have been found in ICU patients with COVID‑19 infections, and may be related to poor prognosis.[67][unreliable medical source?][68][unreliable medical source?] Blood vessel dysfunction and clot formation (as suggested by high D-dimer levels) are thought to play a significant role in mortality, incidences of clots leading to pulmonary embolisms, and ischaemic events within the brain have been noted as complications leading to death in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Infection appears to set off a chain of vasoconstrictive responses within the body, constriction of blood vessels within the pulmonary circulation has also been posited as a mechanism in which oxygenation decreases alongside the presentation of viral pneumonia.[69]

Another common cause of death is complications related to the kidneys.[69] Early reports show that up to 30% of hospitalized patients both in China and in New York have experienced some injury to their kidneys, including some persons with no previous kidney problems.[70]

Autopsies of people who died of COVID‑19 have found diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates within the lung.[71][unreliable medical source?]

Immunopathology
Although SARS-CoV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID‑19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation. Clinical laboratory findings of elevated IL-2, IL-7, IL-6, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interferon-γ inducible protein 10 (IP-10), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1-α (MIP-1α), and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) indicative of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) suggest an underlying immunopathology.[64]

Additionally, people with COVID‑19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have classical serum biomarkers of CRS, including elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, and ferritin.[72]

Systemic inflammation results in vasodilation, allowing inflammatory lymphocytic and monocytic infiltration of the lung and the heart. In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T-cells were shown to correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory IL-6-secreting monocytes and severe lung pathology in COVID‑19 patients.[citation needed] Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported at autopsy.The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.[74] The standard method of testing is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).[75] The test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or sputum sample may also be used.[76][77] Results are generally available within a few hours to two days.[78][79] Blood tests can be used, but these require two blood samples taken two weeks apart, and the results have little immediate value.[80] Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of the coronavirus and publish the genetic sequence so laboratories across the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.[81][82][83] As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which may detect active infections and whether a person had been infected in the past) were in development, but not yet widely used.[84][85][86] Antibody tests may be most accurate 2–3 weeks after a person's symptoms start.[87] The Chinese experience with testing has shown the accuracy is only 60 to 70%.[88] The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first point-of-care test on 21 March 2020 for use at the end of that month.[89] The absence or presence of COVID‑19 signs and symptoms alone is not reliable enough for an accurate diagnosis.[90]

Diagnostic guidelines released by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggested methods for detecting infections based upon clinical features and epidemiological risk. These involved identifying people who had at least two of the following symptoms in addition to a history of travel to Wuhan or contact with other infected people: fever, imaging features of pneumonia, normal or reduced white blood cell count, or reduced lymphocyte count.[91]

A study asked hospitalised COVID‑19 patients to cough into a sterile container, thus producing a saliva sample, and detected the virus in eleven of twelve patients using RT-PCR. This technique has the potential of being quicker than a swab and involving less risk to health care workers (collection at home or in the car).[41]

Along with laboratory testing, chest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID‑19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection but are not recommended for routine screening.[50][92] Bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacities with a peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distribution are common in early infection.[50] Subpleural dominance, crazy paving (lobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling), and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses.[50][93]

In late 2019, the WHO assigned emergency ICD-10 disease codes U07.1 for deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID‑19 without lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.[94]
A COVID-19 vaccine is not expected until 2021 at the earliest.[106] The US National Institutes of Health guidelines do not recommend any medication for prevention of COVID‑19, before or after exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, outside the setting of a clinical trial.[107][108] Without a vaccine, other prophylactic measures, or effective treatments, a key part of managing COVID‑19 is trying to decrease and delay the epidemic peak, known as "flattening the curve".[102] This is done by slowing the infection rate to decrease the risk of health services being overwhelmed, allowing for better treatment of current cases, and delaying additional cases until effective treatments or a vaccine become available.[102][105]

Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, wearing a mask in public, avoiding crowded places, keeping distance from others, washing hands with soap and water often and for at least 20 seconds, practising good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.[109][110][111][112] Those diagnosed with COVID‑19 or who believe they may be infected are advised by the CDC to stay home except to get medical care, call ahead before visiting a healthcare provider, wear a face mask before entering the healthcare provider's office and when in any room or vehicle with another person, cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue, regularly wash hands with soap and water and avoid sharing personal household items.
For health care professionals who may come into contact with COVID‑19 positive bodily fluids, using personal protective coverings on exposed body parts improves protection from the virus.[115] Breathable personal protective equipment improves user-satisfaction and may offer a similar level of protection from the virus.[115] In addition, adding tabs and other modifications to the protective equipment may reduce the risk of contamination during donning and doffing (putting on and taking off the equipment).[115] Implementing an evidence-based donning and doffing protocol such as a one-step glove and gown removal technique, giving oral instructions while donning and doffing, double gloving, and the use of glove disinfection may also improve protection for health care professionals
The World Health Organization (WHO) and most government health agencies (such as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the UK National Health Service (NHS), or the New Zealand Ministry of Health) recommend individuals wear non-medical face coverings in public settings where there is an increased risk of transmission and where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.[116][117][118][119][120] This recommendation is meant to reduce the spread of the disease by asymptomatic and pre-symtomatic individuals and is complementary to established preventive measures such as social distancing.[117][121] Face coverings limit the volume and travel distance of expiratory droplets dispersed when talking, breathing, and coughing.[117][121] Many countries and local jurisdictions encourage or mandate the use of face masks or cloth face coverings by members of the public to limit the spread of the virus.[122][123][124][125]

Masks are also strongly recommended for those who may have been infected and those taking care of someone who may have the disease.[126]
Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact of infected persons with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and cancelling large public gatherings.[127] Distancing guidelines also include that people stay at least 2 metres (6.6 ft) apart.[128] After the implementation of social distancing and stay-at-home orders, many regions have been able to sustain an effective transmission rate ("Rt") of less than one, meaning the disease is in remission in those areas.[129]
When not wearing a mask, the CDC, WHO, and NHS recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if no tissue is available.[110][119][130] Proper hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is encouraged.[110][119] The WHO also recommends that individuals wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after blowing one's nose.[130] The CDC recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available.[119] For areas where commercial hand sanitisers are not readily available, the WHO provides two formulations for local production. In these formulations, the antimicrobial activity arises from ethanol or isopropanol. Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in the alcohol; it is "not an active substance for hand antisepsis". Glycerol is added as a humectant.[131]

Sanitizing of frequently touched surfaces is also recommended or required by regulation for businesses and public facilities; the United States Environmental Protection Agency maintains a list of products expected to be effective.[132]
Early reviews of epidemiologic data showed greater impact of the pandemic and a higher mortality rate in men in China and Italy.[298][2][299] The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the death rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.[300] Later reviews in June 2020 indicated that there is no significant difference in susceptibility or in CFR between genders.[301][302] One review acknowledges the different mortality rates in Chinese men, suggesting that it may be attributable to lifestyle choices such as smoking and drinking alcohol rather than genetic factors.[303] Sex-based immunological differences, lesser prevalence of smoking in women and men developing co-morbid conditions such as hypertension at a younger age than women could have contributed to the higher mortality in men.[304] In Europe, 57% of the infected people were men and 72% of those died with COVID‑19 were men.[305] As of April 2020, the US government is not tracking sex-related data of COVID‑19 infections.[306] Research has shown that viral illnesses like Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.[306]
